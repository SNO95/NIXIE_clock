# NIXIE_clock
ATmega328p and DS3231 based nixie clock.
PCBs are from JLC PCB, the first version had some errors (pictures are the first version, the battery hodlers silk screen was off by 0.5mm and the p channel mosfets in the h bridge were wired wrong, and I forgot the reset pullup on the ATmega) but I think they are fixed now. If you find anything please let me know.
